================

Assignments for Coursera exploratory data analysis

There are in all 6 assignments done in this repository.
Every assignment has an "R" script, corresponding to which there is an "png" file.
Running "R" script would generate the corresponding "png" file ( in the "data" directory inside current directory).
eg, running plot1.R would generate plot1.png , running plot2.R would generate plot2.png and soon.

Data set used in all the "R" scripts is from the location "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip" and 
each "R" script is capable of being executed independently.
